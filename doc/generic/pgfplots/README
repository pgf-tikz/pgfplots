pgfplots - A tool to work with scientific data. It draws normal and/or
logarithmic plots in two and three dimensions for LaTeX/TeX/ConTeXt.  

pgfplotstable - Loads, rounds, formats and postprocesses numerical tables.

Pgfplots draws high-quality function plots in normal or logarithmic scaling for
two- and three dimensional visualization with a user-friendly interface. The
user supplies axis labels, legend entries and the plot coordinates for one or
more plots and Pgfplots applies axis scaling, computes any logarithms and axis
ticks and draws the plots.  It is based on Till Tantau's package PGF/TikZ.

Pgfplotstable displays numerical tables rounded to desired precision in various
display formats, for example scientific format, fixed point format or integer,
using TeX's math facilities for pretty printing.
