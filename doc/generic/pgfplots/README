pgfplots - Create normal/logarithmic plots in two and three dimensions for LaTeX/TeX/ConTeXt.

pgfplotstable - Loads, rounds, formats and postprocesses numerical tables.

PGFPlots draws high--quality function plots in normal or logarithmic scaling
with a user-friendly interface directly in TeX. The user supplies axis labels,
legend entries and the plot coordinates for one or more plots and PGFPlots
applies axis scaling, computes any logarithms and axis ticks and draws the
plots. It supports line plots, scatter plots, piecewise constant plots, bar
plots, area plots, mesh-- and surface plots, patch plots, contour plots, quiver
plots, histogram plots, polar axes, ternary diagrams, smith charts and some
more.

Pgfplots is based on Till Tantau's package PGF/TikZ (pgf).

Pgfplotstable displays numerical tables rounded to desired precision in various
display formats, for example scientific format, fixed point format or integer,
using TeX's math facilities for pretty printing. Furthermore, it provides
methods for table postprocessing.

  doc/latex/pgfplots/pgfplots.pdf
and

HISTORY:
post 1.10:
- new feature: "hide obscured x ticks=false" to disable the feature which hides ticks
- simplified UI for symbolic coords: now, it accepts unexpandable
  dictionary entries including umlauts, undefined macros, math mode, ...
- simplified UI for symbolic coords: added magic prefix 
	[normalized]<number> to allow something like xmin={[normalized]0.7}
- simplified UI for custom annotations: one does not need to say "axis cs" any longer;
  coordinates like (1,2) are now automatically interpreted as (axis cs:1,2)
- new feature: 'type ticklabels with struts' improves baseline alignment of tick labels
- simplified 'external lib': added driver auto-detection for pdflatex, lualatex, xelatex, dvips
	(\usepgfplotslibrary{external}, or, with the next PGF release, \usetikzlibrary{external})
- fixed bug: fillbetween has had a problem with pins on input paths
- fixed bug: now, 'stacked ignores zero' is no longer applied to error bars.
- fixed bug: tick lines were drawn incorrectly for centered axis lines in 3d
- fixed bug: variable=u failed to work in some contexts
- fixed bug: fill between implicitly activated layers, but did not install the
   correct layers for grid lines etc.
- fixed bug: z grid style was applied to y grid style
- fixed bug: using 'x=1cm' failed to work in axis descriptions (legends)
- fixed bug: mesh legend failed to work with 'shader=interp'
- fixed bug: bounding box of shader=interp was wrong if there were transformations.
- fixed bug: added support for \addplot graphics in ConTeXt

1.10:
- new feature: fill between plots (library fillbetween)
- new feature: concatenate intersection segments (library fillbetween)
- fixed bug: xelatex failed to run contour external
- fixed incompatibility with \label and \usepackage{mcaption}
- fixed bug: histograms produced wrong point meta
- fixed bug: histograms reported the wrong 'plot name' and confused shifts of bar plots

1.9:
- new feature: asymmetric error bars
- new feature: activated math parser for axis limit arguments, arguments in axis cs, and domain argument in log plots
- new feature: stacked bar plots place their 'nodes near coords' correctly in the middle and print the increment (compat=1.9)
- new feature: stacked bar plots suppress empty increments (compat=1.9).
- new feature: 'scatter/position=relative|absolute' allow to position 'nodes near coords' absolutely.
   use-case: bar plots + nodes near coords which are at, say, y=0 rather than their y value
- new feature: integration of smooth shadings & auto-CMYK conversion
    \usepackage[cmyk]{xcolor} or \selectcolormodel{cmyk} will reconfigure pgfplots to use CMYK (document-wide)
- new feature (advanced audience only): programmatic access to data coordinates during the visualization phase
	-> allows much more customization for error bars, stacked plots, nodes near coords.
- wrote beginner tutorials
- fixed bug: error bars and point meta did not work together
- fixed bug: stacked plots did not respect 'visualization depends on'
- fixed bug: luatex 0.76 is not backwards compatible; added version switch 
- fixed bug: ternary library precision has been improved

- fixed bug: 3d centered axis lines and label placement (requires compat=1.8 or higher)
- fixed bug: axis lines and placement of labels, tick scale labels, and reversed axes
    (requires compat=1.8 or higher)
- fixed bug: filtering out coords from a mesh plot failed
- fixed bug: every legend image post was not respected inside of \ref{plotlabel}
- fixed bug: high-order patches computed the shader=flat mean in a wrong way.
- fixed bug: remember picture inside of pgfplots axes failed (due to cell picture)
- fixed bug: now, the tick scale label will be omitted if there are no ticks
- fixed bug: axis box path was not closed
- fixed bug: the bounding box was non-empty even if the axis was hidden.
- fixed bug: auto-alignment of nodes near coords failed for xbar plots
- fixed bug: providing bar width / bar shift in terms of axis units did
    not work with [xy]bar and nodes near coords
- fixed bug: transformation 'data cs=cart' -> polar is more robust now
- fixed bug: code did not compile against pgf 2.00
- fixed bug: patch plot lib and shader=interp,patch type=biquadratic
