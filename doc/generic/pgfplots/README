pgfplots - Create normal/logarithmic plots in two and three dimensions for LaTeX/TeX/ConTeXt.

pgfplotstable - Loads, rounds, formats and postprocesses numerical tables.

PGFPlots draws high-quality function plots in normal or logarithmic scaling
with a user-friendly interface directly in TeX. The user supplies axis labels,
legend entries and the plot coordinates for one or more plots and PGFPlots
applies axis scaling, computes any logarithms and axis ticks and draws the
plots, supporting line plots, scatter plots, piecewise constant plots, bar
plots, area plots, mesh-- and surface plots and some more.

Pgfplots is based on Till Tantau's package PGF/TikZ (pgf).

Pgfplotstable displays numerical tables rounded to desired precision in various
display formats, for example scientific format, fixed point format or integer,
using TeX's math facilities for pretty printing. Furthermore, it provides
methods for table postprocessing.

REMARK
The virus killer Avira Antivir reports the virus HTML/Malicious PDF.Gen in pgfplots.pdf. 
This is a FALSE ALARM caused by the pgfplots library for interactive,
clickable plots (based on javascript). It is virus-free.
