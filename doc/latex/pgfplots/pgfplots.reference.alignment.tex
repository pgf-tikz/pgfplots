\label{sec:pgfplots:sec:align}

\subsection{Basic Alignment}

Alignment works with two main methods: a coordinate where the axis shall be
drawn and an ``anchor'' inside of the axis which shall be drawn at this
particular coordinate. This methodology is common for each \Tikz{} node -- and
an axis is nothing but a (special) \Tikz{} node. The coordinate can be
specified using the |at| key, while the anchor can be specified with the
|anchor| key. In most cases, it is sufficient to provide only an anchor --
unless one needs more than one axis in the same picture environment.

\begin{pgfplotskey}{at=\marg{coordinate expression}}
    Assigns a position for the complete axis image. This option works similarly
    to the |at| option of |\node[at=|\marg{coordinate expression}|]|,
    see~\cite{tikz}. The common syntax is |at={|\parg{x,y}|}|.

    The idea is to provide an \meta{coordinate expression} where the axis will
    be placed. The axis' anchor will be placed at \meta{coordinate expression}.
\end{pgfplotskey}

\begin{pgfplotskey}{anchor=\marg{name} (initially south west)}
\label{option:anchor}
    Chooses one of the different possible positions inside of an axis which is
    placed with |at|. The |at| key defines the position where to place the axis
    inside of the embedding picture, the |anchor| key defines which point of
    the axis shall be positioned by `|at|'. The initial configuration assumes
    |at={(0,0)}|. Thus, |anchor=center| will place the axis' center at the
    logical picture position $(0,0)$. Similarly, |anchor=south west| will
    position the lower left corner of the axis at $(0,0)$.

    For users who are familiar with \Tikz{}: an axis is actually a very special
    node, so anchors work as in~\cite{tikz}.

    Anchors are useful in conjunction with horizontal or vertical alignment of
    plots, see the examples below.

    There are four sets of anchors available: anchors positioned on the axis
    bounding box, anchors on the outer bounding box and anchors which have one
    coordinate on the outer bounding box and the other one at a position of the
    axis rectangle. Finally, one can place anchors near the origin.

    %
    In more detail, we have anchors on the axis rectangle (the bounding box
    around the axis),\footnote{Versions prior to \PGFPlots{} v.1.3 did
    \emph{not} use the bounding box of the axis, they used axis coordinates to
    orient these anchors. This has been fixed. If you \emph{really} want to
    undo the bugfix, see
    \texttt{\protect\pgfmanualpdfref{compat/anchors}{compat/anchors}}.}

    Anchors on the outer bounding box,

    There are anchors which have one coordinate on the outer bounding box, and

                \plot

            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
    %
    And finally, we have origin anchors which are especially useful when axis
    lines pass through the origin,
    %
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \begin{axis}[
                    name=test plot,
                    axis x line=center,
                    axis y line=center,
                    enlargelimits=false,
                    minor tick num=3,
                    tick style={semithick},
                    tick align=center,
                    xlabel=$x$,
                    ylabel=$y$,
                    every axis x label/.style={
                        at={(current axis.right of origin)},
                        anchor=north east,
                    },
                    every axis y label/.style={
                        at={(current axis.above origin)},
                        anchor=north east,
                    },
                    inner axis line style={->},
                ]
                    \addplot+ [domain=-2:5] {20*x};
                \end{axis}
                {\pgfplotsset{every pin/.append style={pin distance=1cm}}%
                \showit{above origin}{45}
                }%
                \showit{right of origin}{45}
                {\pgfplotsset{every pin/.append style={pin distance=1cm}}%
                \showit{below origin}{0}
                }%
                \showit{left of origin}{135}
                \showit{origin}{135}
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}

    \noindent There is a fifth anchor which is not directly related to the
    axis: you can provide the anchor of \emph{a named inner node}. Thus, you
    can define your own anchor, by writing
    |\node (|\meta{name}|) at |\parg{point coordinate}| {};| as follows (using
    the |baseline| option described below):
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
Aligning at .......
\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline]
\begin{axis}[small,anchor=aninnernode.center]
    \addplot {sin(deg(x))};
    \node
        [pin=-90:(aninnernode),fill=black,circle,scale=0.3]
            (aninnernode) at (-2,0.75) {};
    \draw [help lines] (-6,0.75) -- (6,0.75);
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    \noindent What happens is that a node is placed at |(-2,0.75)|. Note that
    the options |[pin=...]| are merely to show the |\node| (the pin style has
    been defined by the \PGFPlots{} manual). Since a name can also be assigned
    using |name=|\meta{node's name} and since any \PGFPlots{} description is
    also a |\node|, you can align your plot at selected axis descriptions:
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
Aligning at .......
\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline]
\begin{axis}[
    small,
    title={The function $\sin x$ is very pretty.},
    title style={name=MyTitleNode},
    anchor=MyTitleNode.base,
]
    \addplot {sin(deg(x))};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

    The default value is |anchor=south west|. You can use anchors in
    conjunction with the \Tikz{} |baseline| option and/or
    |\begin{pgfinterruptboundingbox}| to perform alignment.


    \paragraph{Remarks:}

    Each of the anchors on the axis rectangle has an equivalent to a coordinate
    in the |axis description cs| described in
    Section~\ref{pgfplots:sec:axis:description:cs}. That means the first set of
    anchors actually lives on the \emph{tight bounding box around the axis}
    (without any ticks or descriptions). The |south west| anchor will always be
    the lower left corner of this bounding box, even in case of a rotated or
    skewed coordinate system.\footnote{Note that this is only true for versions
    since 1.3.} Similar statements hold for the other anchors.

    }


    \subsection{Vertical Alignment with \texttt{baseline}}
    \label{sec:align}

    \begin{key}{/tikz/baseline}
        The |baseline| option should be provided as argument to a
        |tikzpicture|. It configures \Tikz{} to shift the picture position
        $y=0$ to the embedding text's baseline:
        %
\begin{codeexample}[width=3cm]
This is \tikz[baseline]\fill [red] (0,0) circle(3pt); a picture,
here \tikz[baseline]\fill [red] (0,10pt) circle(3pt); another one.
\end{codeexample}
        %
        \noindent Consequently, the |baseline| option allows to align different
        |tikzpicture|s. An axis is, by default, placed with |at={(0,0)}|, and
        the |anchor| key specifies which part of the axis is placed at |(0,0)|.
        Consequently, the |baseline| option, together with |anchor|, allows to
        align different axes with the embedding text.

        The default axis anchor is |south west|, which means that the picture
        coordinate $(0,0)$ is the lower left corner of the axis. As a
        consequence, the \Tikz{} option ``|baseline|'' allows vertical
        alignment of adjacent plots:
        %
\begin{codeexample}[]
% 1. Unaligned:
\pgfplotsset{domain=-1:1}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[xlabel=A normal sized $x$ label]
        \addplot [smooth,blue,mark=*] {x^2};
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}%
    \hspace{0.15cm}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[xlabel={$\displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^N n_i $ }]
        \addplot [smooth,blue,mark=*] {x^2};
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

\begin{codeexample}[]
% 2. Aligned:
\pgfplotsset{domain=-1:1}
\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline]
    \begin{axis}[xlabel=A normal sized $x$ label]
        \addplot [smooth,blue,mark=*] {x^2};
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}%
    \hspace{0.15cm}
\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline]
    \begin{axis}[xlabel={$\displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^N n_i $ }]
        \addplot [smooth,blue,mark=*] {x^2};
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

        Note that it is also possible to write |baseline=5cm| in which case the
        image offset at $y=\;$|5cm| will be used as baseline.
    \end{key}

    The |baseline| key is related to |\begin{minipage}|\oarg{alignment} or
    |\begin{tabular}|\oarg{alignment}: the \meta{alignment} tells \LaTeX{}
    which part of the |minipage| or |tabular| shall be positioned on the
    baseline. Thus, |baseline| does the same for pictures (with more freedom
    for \meta{alignment}).


    \subsection{Horizontal Alignment}
    \label{sec:halign}

    Horizontal alignment can be done in two ways:
    %
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Using separate |tikzpicture| environments which have reduced
            bounding boxes or
        \item A single |tikzpicture| environment in which the complete
            alignment is done.
    \end{enumerate}
    %
    The first approach requires the use of reduced bounding boxes and is
    discussed in Section~\ref{sec:bb}.

    The second approach, a single |tikzpicture| environment, employs the |at|
    and |anchor| keys to align parts of the images. For example, if you place
    multiple |axes| into a single |tikzpicture| and use the `|anchor|' option,
    you can control horizontal alignment:
    %
\message{'warning /pgfplots/warning/approx empty range enlarged' is expected here.^^J}%
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
\pgfplotsset{
  every axis/.append style={
    cycle list={
        {red,only marks,mark=*,
         mark options={fill=red,scale=0.8}},
        {black,only marks,mark=square*,
         mark options={fill=black,scale=0.8}}
    },
  },
}
\begin{axis}[
    width=4cm,scale only axis,
    name=main plot,
]
  \addplot file {plotdata/pgfplots_scatterdata1.dat};
  \addplot file {plotdata/pgfplots_scatterdata2.dat};
  \addplot [blue] coordinates {
      (0.093947,    -0.011481)
      (0.101957,    0.494273)
      (0.109967,    1.000027)
  };
\end{axis}
\begin{axis}[
    at={(main plot.below south west)},yshift=-0.1cm,
    anchor=north west,
    width=4cm,scale only axis,height=0.8cm,
    ytick=\empty,
]
    \addplot file
        {plotdata/pgfplots_scatterdata1_latent.dat};
    \addplot file
        {plotdata/pgfplots_scatterdata2_latent.dat};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

    Here, the second axis uses |at={(main plot.below south west)}| to be placed
    below the first one. Furthermore, it has |yshift=-0.1cm| in order to leave
    additional space, and it uses |anchor=north west| to place the upper left
    corner at the specified position. Instead of the |at={}| construction, we
    could also have used |yshift| with larger negative shift.


    \subsection{Alignment In Array Form (Subplots)}
    \label{sec:pgfplots:arrayform}
        \index{Subplots}%
        \index{Alignment!Subplots}%
        \index{Alignment!Array}%
        \index{array!Array Alignment}%

    \pgfmanualpdflabel{\textbackslash matrix}{}%

    Sometimes multiple alignment axes in array form are desired. \PGFPlots{}
    supports this task in several ways which are described in the following.
    There are basically three related, yet different, approaches:
    %
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Simply place |\begin{tikzpicture}...\end{tikzpicture}| into a
            \LaTeX{} table. This is straightforward; you would do the very
            same thing with |\includegraphics|.

            In addition to |\includegraphics|, the |baseline| feature allows
            simple yet effective vertical alignment. In addition, the
            |trim left| and |trim right| features allow simple yet effective
            horizontal alignment (see below).
        \item Use a \emph{single} picture which contains an array of axes,
            i.e.\@ a pattern like

            |\begin{tikzpicture} \matrix{ |\meta{multiple axes}| }; \end{tikzpicture}|.

            This allows considerably simpler alignment! Alas, it needs special
            handling for |legend entries| due to a weakness of |\matrix|. If
            you use the |external| library (which is recommended), it takes
            more time since the picture gets larger.
        \item Use the |groupplots| library shipped with \PGFPlots{}. It is
            specialized on axes in array form with particular strength if the
            axes are closely related (for example if they share axis
            descriptions like |xlabel| or even tick labels). Note, however,
            that the other approaches are better when it comes to automatic
            handling of bounding boxes.
    \end{enumerate}
    %
    The |groupplots| library is discussed in all detail in
    Section~\ref{sec:group:plot}. This section discusses the other two
    approaches.


    \paragraph{Array Alignment using \LaTeX{} Tables}

    The idea is simple: use a \LaTeX{} table and provide one |tikzpicture| for
    every cell. You are probably familiar with this sort of alignment, perhaps
    together with |\includegraphics|. It works in the very same way for
    \PGFPlots{}. The approach is the simplest one since it doesn't need special
    knowledge. Its disadvantage, however, is more difficulty to control
    positions \emph{inside} of the image (like differently sized axis
    descriptions).

    Is is strongly recommended to employ the |baseline| option for each cell
    picture, which simplifies vertical alignment considerably. If you want a
    simple solution to place separate axes in array form, and you prefer to use
    one |tikzpicture| for every axis, the probably most simple and most
    effective way to get horizontal alignment are the |trim left| and
    |trim right| features -- or styles based on them:

    The |trim axis left| feature can be used to exclude axis descriptions on
    the left from the bounding box, and the |trim axis right| can exclude axis
    descriptions on the right from the bounding box. Thus, alignment is done
    using the vertical axis lines. Since both keys effectively modify the
    bounding box, they are documented in Section~\ref{sec:bb} ``Bounding Box
    Restrictions''. Here is just a small example for array alignment by means
    of |tabular|, |baseline| and the |trim left|/|trim right| features:
    %
\begin{codeexample}[vbox]
\pgfplotsset{
    small,
    title=Trimmed bounding boxes
}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline,trim axis left]
        \begin{axis}
            \addplot {x};
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
        &
    \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline,trim axis right]
        \begin{axis}[
            ylabel={$f(x)=x^2$},
            yticklabel pos=upper,
            ylabel style={font=\Huge},
        ]
            \addplot {x^2};
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
        \\
    \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline,trim axis left]
        \begin{axis}[xlabel=$x$,xlabel style={font=\Huge}]
            \addplot {x^3};
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
        &
    \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline,trim axis right]
        \begin{axis}[yticklabel pos=upper]
            \addplot {x^4};
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
        \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    \noindent The example has $2 \times 2$ axes. The |baseline| feature
    controls the vertical alignment: the lower axis lines are always on the
    same height. The |trim axis left| key is a style which tells \Tikz{} to
    trim everything which is left of the left axis line. Similarly, the
    |trim axis right| key does not include picture parts right of the right
    axis line. Together with |\begin{center}| and the |yticklabel pos=upper|
    key, we get correct horizontal and vertical alignment together with
    centering at the left and right axis lines (without descriptions).

    A strong advantage is that this type of alignment requires almost no
    changes to your pictures. Thus, you can copy--paste existing images (\TeX{}
    code) relatively simple.

    Note that the approach is fully compatible with the image |external|ization
    library: each picture is exported separately, and the bounding box
    restrictions (and the |baseline| offset) are stored in separate |.dpth|
    files. The |trim left|/|trim right| approach for horizontal alignment is
    the \emph{only} supported way for reduced bounding boxes and image
    externalization.


    \paragraph{Array Alignment using \Tikz{} Matrices}

    While it is possible to use (for example) |tabular| combined with the
    vertical and horizontal alignment methods discussed above, it might be
    better to use a \Tikz{} |matrix| since it automatically handles the size of
    axis descriptions.

    A \Tikz{} matrix is some sort of ``graphical'' table. It knows everything
    about picture alignment and it has more flexibility than |tabular| when it
    comes to graphics. The idea is to pack the complete array into a
    \emph{single} picture.

    The complete documentation of a \Tikz{} matrix is beyond the scope of this
    manual, please refer to \cite{tikz} for details. But we provide an example
    here:
    %
\pgfmanualpdflabel{/tikz/matrix}{}%
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
        \pgfplotsset{small}
    \matrix {
        \begin{axis}
            \addplot {x};
        \end{axis}
           &
        % differently large labels are aligned automatically:
        \begin{axis}[ylabel={$f(x)=x^2$},ylabel style={font=\Huge}]
            \addplot {x^2};
        \end{axis}
            \\
        \begin{axis}[xlabel=$x$,xlabel style={font=\Huge}]
            \addplot {x^3};
        \end{axis}
            &
        \begin{axis}
            \addplot {x^4};
        \end{axis}
            \\
    };
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    \noindent So, a matrix is a picture element inside of |tikzpicture|. Its
    cells are separated by `|&|' as in tabular (or, if `|&|' causes problems,
    with |\pgfmatrixnextcell|). Its rows are separated by `|\\|'. Each cell is
    aligned using the cells' anchor. Since, by default, the anchor of an axis
    is placed at the lower left corner, the example above is completely
    aligned, without the need for any bounding box modifications -- even the
    labels are aligned correctly. If another anchor shall be used, simply place
    %
\begin{codeexample}[code only]
    \pgfplotsset{anchor=...}
\matrix {
    ...
};
\end{codeexample}
    %
    \noindent in front of the matrix. This will use the same configuration for
    every sub-plot.


    \paragraph{Attention:}

    Unfortunately, the array alignment with |\matrix| needs special
    \emph{attention with legends}. A legend is also a |\matrix| and \Tikz{}
    matrices can't be nested. You will need to use the |legend to name| feature
    (or to assemble a legend by means of |\label| and |\ref|) to overcome this
    weakness (see Section~\ref{pgfplots:legend:labelref} for details).


    \subsection{Miscellaneous for Alignment}

    \begin{predefinednode}{current axis}
        A node which refers to the current axis or the last typeset axis.

        You can use this node in axis descriptions, for example to place axis
        labels or titles.


        \paragraph{Remark:}

        If you use |current axis| inside of axis descriptions, the ``current
        axis'' is not yet finished. That means you \emph{can't use any outer
        anchor} inside of axis descriptions.

        It is also possible to use |current axis| in any drawing or plotting
        commands inside of an axis (but no outer anchor as these are not
        defined when drawing commands are processed). This usage is similar to
        the |axis description cs|.
